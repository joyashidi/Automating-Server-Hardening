# Automating-Server-Hardening
CyberGirls 4.0 - Open day project (Group 3)
In this project, we enhanced our Windows Server's security and efficiency through automation and best practices. Using PowerShell scripts, we automated tasks like setting up firewalls, disabling unnecessary services, updating software, and implementing security policies (e.g windows update policy, audit policy, account lockout policy and strong password policy).
